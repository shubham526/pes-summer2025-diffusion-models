## Mini-Project üõ†Ô∏è
The mini-project is a key component of this course, designed to give students hands-on experience in developing, training, and applying diffusion models to practical problems.
* **Format:** Team-based (teams of two students). Projects will be announced on Day 1.
* **Task:** Develop, implement, and present a working diffusion model application. This must demonstrate the successful implementation of a diffusion process, training methodology, and sampling procedure.
* **Work:** Teams are expected to work on the project independently outside of class hours. No separate time will be allocated during teaching hours for project work.
* **Evaluation:** Projects will be evaluated on Day 5.
* **Creativity:** Creativity and originality are encouraged.
* **Guidelines:**
    * All projects must include a working code implementation and a live demonstration during the final presentation.
    * Students are encouraged to explore creative applications of diffusion models beyond the examples provided.
    * Clear documentation and well-organized code will be considered in the final assessment.

### Suggested Mini-Project Topics
Teams of two students will select a project topic from the list below or propose a custom topic (subject to instructor approval).
* Image Denoising using Diffusion Models (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10)
* Image Inpainting with Diffusion
* Class-Conditional Image Generation
* Text-to-Image Generation with Simple Prompts
* Super-Resolution via Diffusion
* Latent Diffusion Modeling
* Time Series Data Generation (e.g., stock prices, ECG patterns)
* Style Transfer through Diffusion Interpolation
* Noise Scheduling Experiments (linear, cosine, learned)
* Guided Handwriting Generation (conditioned on characters)

### Custom Projects
Students may propose their own mini-projects, provided they meet the following requirements:
* The project must involve the core concepts of diffusion modeling, training, and sampling.
* The project must be sufficiently challenging and require original implementation work.
* A short proposal (title, description, expected outcomes, and dataset to be used) must be submitted for approval by the instructor within the first two days of the course. (A proposal form is available in the syllabus).

## Assessment üíØ
The course will be evaluated based on a team-based mini-project, which constitutes **100% of the final grade**. The assessment will be based on demonstrating technical understanding, problem-solving skills, creativity, and the ability to apply course concepts to real-world scenarios.

The assessment dimensions are:
* **Technical Implementation (40%):** Correctness, efficiency, and completeness of the diffusion model implementation.
* **Oral Presentation (20%):** Clarity, structure, and professionalism of the project presentation.
* **Quality of Results (20%):** Quality of generated outputs, experimental results, and evaluation metrics.
* **Understanding of Theoretical Concepts (20%):** Depth of understanding demonstrated through explanation and responses to questions.

A detailed rubric is available in the course syllabus (Table 2).

## Required Reading üìñ
* **"Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics"**
    * Available at: [https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html)
    * Specific chapters will be specified in the detailed schedule.

## Software and Setup üíª
* **Python:** A recent version of Python (e.g., 3.8+) is recommended.
* **PyTorch:** Proficiency in PyTorch is a prerequisite. Ensure you have a working PyTorch environment.
* **Other Libraries:** Specific labs might require additional Python libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `torchvision`, etc.). These will be mentioned in the respective lab READMEs and notebooks.
* **Google Colab:** Lab notebooks are designed to be run on Google Colab to ensure a consistent environment with necessary compute resources (like GPUs).

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., Conda, venv) if running labs locally, though Colab is the primary platform for labs.
