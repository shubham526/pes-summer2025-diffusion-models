# Lab 3: Mathematical Foundations of Generative Models - Hands-On Implementation

**Course:** Diffusion Models: Theory and Applications  
**Assignment Type:** Mathematical Theory Lab  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Team Size:** 2 students (same teams from Labs 1-2)  

## üìã Assignment Overview

This lab takes you to the mathematical heart of generative modeling. You'll implement the fundamental mathematical framework that underlies **all** modern generative models - from VAEs to GANs to diffusion models. By building the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) from first principles, you'll understand the universal mathematical solution to the generative modeling problem.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. **Implement** the complete ELBO derivation from first principles
2. **Build** KL divergence calculations and explore their asymmetric properties
3. **Create** Jensen's inequality demonstrations showing how lower bounds work
4. **Construct** the two-forces analysis of reconstruction vs regularization
5. **Connect** mathematical theory to practical optimization algorithms
6. **Prepare** the foundation for understanding diffusion model mathematics

## üöÄ The Central Problem

This lab addresses the fundamental question: **Why is generative modeling mathematically difficult, and how do we solve it?**

### The Crisis:
- **Direct likelihood:** `p(x) = ‚à´ p(x|z)p(z) dz` - **INTRACTABLE**
- **Bayes rule:** `p(z|x) = p(x|z)p(z)/p(x)` - **CIRCULAR**
- **Monte Carlo:** High variance, exponentially expensive

### The Solution:
- **Jensen's inequality:** Creates tractable lower bounds
- **ELBO:** `log p(x) ‚â• E[log p(x|z)] - KL(q(z|x)||p(z))`
- **Variational inference:** Optimize bounds instead of intractable quantities

You must complete these essential mathematical components:

### **The Intractable Likelihood Crisis**
```python
class IntractableLikelihoodDemo:
    def sample_prior(self, n_samples):
        # TODO: Sample from p(z) = N(0, I)
        
    def likelihood_given_z(self, x, z):
        # TODO: Compute p(x|z) = N(x; f_Œ∏(z), œÉ¬≤I)
        
    def approximate_marginal_likelihood(self, x, n_samples=1000):
        # TODO: Monte Carlo estimation of p(x) = ‚à´ p(x|z)p(z) dz
        # Watch this fail spectacularly!
```

### **KL Divergence Mathematics**
```python
class KLDivergenceBuilder:
    def monte_carlo_kl(self, p_samples, p_logprob_fn, q_logprob_fn):
        # TODO: KL(p||q) = E_p[log p(x) - log q(x)]
        
    def gaussian_kl_closed_form(self, mu1, sigma1, mu2, sigma2):
        # TODO: Analytical KL for Gaussians
        
    def standard_normal_kl(self, mu, logvar):
        # TODO: KL(N(Œº,œÉ¬≤) || N(0,I)) - most common in practice
```

### **ELBO Framework**
```python
class ELBOFramework:
    def reparameterize(self, mu, logvar):
        # TODO: z = Œº + œÉ * Œµ where Œµ ~ N(0,I)
        
    def reconstruction_loss(self, x, x_recon_mu, x_recon_logvar):
        # TODO: E_q[log p(x|z)] - likelihood of data under decoder
        
    def kl_regularization(self, mu, logvar):
        # TODO: KL(q(z|x) || p(z)) - stay close to prior
        
    def compute_elbo(self, x):
        # TODO: ELBO = Reconstruction - Regularization
```

### **Two Forces Analysis**
```python
class TwoForcesAnalysis:
    def analyze_beta_vae(self, data, beta_values=[0.0, 0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0]):
        # TODO: Loss = -Reconstruction + Œ≤ * KL
        # Show how Œ≤ controls reconstruction vs regularization tradeoff
```

## üî¨ Key Mathematical Insights

### **The Intractable Integral**
`p(x) = ‚à´ p(x|z)p(z) dz`

- **Monte Carlo problems:** Variance, computational cost, poor coverage

### **Jensen's Inequality Magic**
`log(E[X]) ‚â• E[log(X)]` for concave log function
- **Creates lower bounds:** Tractable approximations to intractable quantities
- **Gap interpretation:** The bound tightness tells us approximation quality

### **The ELBO Decomposition**
`log p(x) ‚â• E_q[log p(x|z)] - KL(q(z|x) || p(z))`
- **Reconstruction term:** How well can we recreate the data?

### **KL Divergence Asymmetry**
`KL(p||q) ‚â† KL(q||p)`
- **Forward KL:** Mode-covering (q must cover all of p)
- **Reverse KL:** Mode-seeking (q focuses on high-density regions of p)
- **Practical impact:** Determines approximation behavior

```
log p(x|z) = -0.5 * [log(2œÄ) + log(œÉ¬≤) + (x-Œº)¬≤/œÉ¬≤]
```

**KL Divergence (Gaussians):**
