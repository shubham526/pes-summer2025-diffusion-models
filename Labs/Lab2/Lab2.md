# Lab 2: Mastering the Forward Diffusion Process - Mathematical Implementation

**Course:** Diffusion Models: Theory and Applications  
**Assignment Type:** Mathematical Programming Lab  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Team Size:** 2 students (same teams from Lab 1)  


## üìã Assignment Overview

Building on Lab 1's foundational implementations, this lab dives deep into the mathematical engine that makes diffusion models computationally feasible. You'll implement the critical mathematical transformations that enable practical training and understand why these models can actually work at scale.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. **Implement** the reparameterization trick and understand its crucial role in making diffusion trainable
2. **Build** different noise schedules (linear, cosine, exponential) and analyze their effects
3. **Derive and implement** the forward jump formula from first principles
4. **Create** efficient training data generation pipelines using Gaussian arithmetic
5. **Analyze** signal-to-noise ratios and variance evolution throughout the diffusion process
6. **Compare** computational complexity with and without forward jumps

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have:

- **Technical Foundation:**

## üöÄ The Computational Revolution

This lab addresses the fundamental question: **How do we make diffusion models trainable and fast?**

Without the mathematical insights you'll implement today, diffusion models would be:
- **Computationally intractable** (requiring 1000 sequential steps for training)

- **Impractical** (millions of parameters learning from corrupt data)

Your implementations will achieve:
- **1000x speedup** through forward jumps
- **Gradient flow preservation** via reparameterization
- **Unlimited training data** from any clean image

## ‚úÖ Core Implementation Tasks

You must complete these essential mathematical components:

### **Reparameterization Trick (Part 2)**
```python
class ReparameterizationDemo:
    def direct_sampling_approach(self, mu, sigma):
        # TODO: Sample directly from N(mu, sigma^2) - breaks gradients!
        
    def reparameterized_approach(self, mu, sigma):
        # TODO: Use z = mu + sigma * eps where eps ~ N(0,1) - preserves gradients!
```

### **Noise Schedules (Part 3)**
```python
class NoiseScheduler:
    def linear_schedule(self, beta_start=1e-4, beta_end=0.02):
        # TODO: Implement linear interpolation schedule
        
    def cosine_schedule(self, s=0.008):
        # TODO: Implement the cosine schedule from improved DDPM paper
        
    def exponential_schedule(self, beta_start=1e-4, beta_end=0.02):
        # TODO: Implement exponential growth schedule
        
    def precompute_schedule(self, schedule_type="linear"):
        # TODO: Compute alpha_cumprod and derived quantities
```

### **Forward Jumps (Part 4)**
```python
class ForwardJumpImplementation:
    def sequential_forward_process(self, x0, target_timestep):
        # TODO: Apply timesteps sequentially (slow but conceptually clear)
        
    def direct_forward_jump(self, x0, target_timestep):
        # TODO: Jump directly to timestep t using precomputed coefficients
```

### **Training Data Generation (Part 5)**
```python
class DiffusionTrainingDataGenerator:
    def generate_training_sample(self, x0):
        # TODO: Create (x_t, t, epsilon) training triples efficiently
```

## üìä Expected Results

By the end of the lab, you should achieve:

- **Working reparameterization** showing gradient flow preservation vs breaking
- **Complete noise schedules** with proper mathematical properties
- **1000x speedup** from forward jumps vs sequential application
- **Efficient training pipeline** generating unlimited samples from any image
- **Mathematical validation** confirming all implementations are correct

## üî¨ Key Mathematical Insights

### **The Reparameterization Revolution**
Instead of sampling `z ~ N(mu, sigma^2)`, compute `z = mu + sigma * eps` where `eps ~ N(0,1)`
- **Why it matters:** Preserves gradient flow through stochastic operations
- **Application:** Makes diffusion models trainable via backpropagation

### **The Forward Jump Formula**
`x_t = sqrt(alpha_cumprod_t) * x0 + sqrt(1 - alpha_cumprod_t) * epsilon`
- **Why it works:** Gaussian arithmetic allows collapsing multiple steps
- **Impact:** O(1) complexity instead of O(T) for training data generation

### **Schedule Design Philosophy**
- **Linear:** Simple, uniform corruption rate
- **Cosine:** Gentle early corruption, aggressive later
- **Exponential:** Very gentle early, very aggressive later
