## üî¨ Key Mathematical Insights

### **The Four-Step ELBO Transformation**

**Step 1 - Strategic Separation:**
```
log p(x‚ÇÄ:T) = log p(xT) + log p(x‚ÇÄ|x‚ÇÅ) + Œ£ log p(x_{t-1}|x_t)
log q(x‚ÇÅ:T|x‚ÇÄ) = Œ£ log q(x_t|x_{t-1})
```

**Step 2 - Index Alignment:**
Align forward and reverse sums to run over same timesteps

**Step 3 - Bayes Rule Magic:**
```
q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x‚ÇÄ) = q(x_t|x_{t-1})q(x_{t-1}|x‚ÇÄ) / q(x_t|x‚ÇÄ)
```

**Step 4 - Three Forces:**
```
ELBO = E[log p(x‚ÇÄ|x‚ÇÅ)] - KL(q(xT|x‚ÇÄ)||p(xT)) - Œ£ KL(q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x‚ÇÄ)||p_Œ∏(x_{t-1}|x_t))
```

### **The Optimal Interpolation Formula**
```
ŒºÃÉ_t(x_t, x‚ÇÄ) = (‚àö·æ±_{t-1} Œ≤_t)/(1-·æ±_t) * x‚ÇÄ + (‚àöŒ±_t (1-·æ±_{t-1}))/(1-·æ±_t) * x_t
```

### **The Noise Prediction Breakthrough**
```
ŒºÃÉ_t(x_t, Œµ) = (1/‚àöŒ±_t) * (x_t - (1-Œ±_t)/‚àö(1-·æ±_t) * Œµ)
```

### **The Simple Training Loss**
```
L = E_{t,Œµ} [||Œµ - Œµ_Œ∏(x_t, t)||¬≤]
```
